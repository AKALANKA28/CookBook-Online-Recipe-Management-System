<h2> Information Collection </h2><br><br>
<p> We may collect personal identification information from Users in various ways, including when Users visit
  our System, register on the System, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we
   make available on our System. Users may be asked for their name, email address, and other relevant 
   information. Users may, however, visit our System anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from 
   Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal
    identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain System-related activities.
</p>

<br><br>

<h2> Sharing Personal Information </h2><br><br>
<p> We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information 
 not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted
  affiliates, and advertisers.
</p>

<br><br>

<h2> Changes to this Privacy Policy </h2><br><br>
<p> We have the discretion to update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom 
 of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal
  information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become 
  aware of modifications.
